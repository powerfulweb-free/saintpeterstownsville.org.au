We welcome you to our beautiful Church, whose parish has been serving the Townsville community for well over a century. We offer a blend of traditional and contemporary Anglican liturgy for all ages, and aim to be a welcoming community.

We are are unique in Townsville in that we are a  “Ministering Community” – a community of volunteers who work together in common worship and prayer.
