The Anglican Church believes baptism is the gift of our Lord Jesus Christ.

When he had risen from the dead, he commanded his followers to go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

The word baptism means “plunging”. Jesus was baptised in the river Jordan by John. Baptism with water signifies the cleansing from sin that Jesus’ death makes possible, and the new life that God gives us through the Holy Spirit.

In baptism, the promises of God are visibly signed and sealed for us. We are joined to Christ, and made members of his body, the universal Church.

Children are baptised (also called christening) in response to God’s all-embracing love. Parents and Godparents who have responded to that love come to bring their children for baptism.

Before the congregation the Parents and Godparents express their own trust and commitment to God and their intention to bring up their children in the faith and practice of the Church.

In due time, these children should make their own response to God and be prepared for confirmation.

Adults are always welcome to explore baptism at Saint Peters. Adults choose a sponsor(s) to guide them in their life long journey with Christ. We are happy to help you find a sponsor. Our welcoming faith community will help guide you though the process.

Baptism is a community event, welcoming both Adults and Children as new members of Christ’s flock and providing an opportunity for all the baptised to renew their vows. The baptism is simply the beginning of our life of faith, as we join God’s family.

In confirmation those who have been previously baptised (whether as children or adults) come to reaffirm their faith through the strenghtening and renewal of their baptismal promises and to join with the other candidates to receive the laying on of the bishop’s hand with prayer.

We pray that those who are baptised and confirmed will be empowered by the Holy Spirit for the ministry and service to which God shall call them. At Saint Peter’s, confirmations take place each November when the Bishop visits us.

For more information please see us on any Sunday at 9am.
