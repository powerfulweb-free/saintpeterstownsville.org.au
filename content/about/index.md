About
At Saint Peters we use the gifts of everyone to be a community of faith, hope and love. The church is not a community gathered around a minister, but a ministering community.

In this community, clergy and laity work alongside each other in a shared ministry.

At Saint Peters we try to identify each person’s gifts and make use of these gifts in carrying out our ministries as the people of God.

Our Church
Unlike traditional Gothic designed churches, St. Peter’s is built in a square form around a central altar. This draws upon the earliest Christian worship traditions, before the development of large churches where everyone sits in front of an altar.
