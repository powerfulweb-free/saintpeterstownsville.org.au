Unless we are busy with Messy Church (see below) every Sunday at 9am we have our regular Eucharist Service. At Saint Peter’s we follow the liturgical calendar throughout the year.

Our church draws on High Church or Anglo-Catholic traditions. That is both the word of the gospel and traditional worship. While our service is based on ‘A Prayer Book For Australia’, we utilise projectors in our church so that no reading from a prayer book during the service is required.

All are most welcome at our services – whether you are new to Christianity or from another Christian denomination.
